### Technologies

**document-manager** makes use of a host of modern technologies. The core ones are:

* REACT: This project makes use of the REACT Javascript library to build the interface. REACT is used for building web pages that are structured as a collection of components. For more information about  See [this link](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
* ECMAScript 6: Also known as ES2015, this is the newest version of Javascript with 
    next-generation features like arrow functions, generators, enhanced object literals, 
    spread operators and more. The ES2015 is consistently used throughout this project. See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) for details.
* NodeJS: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. 
    See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) for details.
* ExressJS: ExpressJS, is a web application framework for Node.js, It is designed for building web applications and APIs. 
    see [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js).
* Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are       easy to test. For more information about Redux see [this link](http://redux.js.org/) for details.
* Materializecss is used to style the frontend. For more information about materializecss see [this link](http://materializecss.com/) for details.
* Webpack: Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging modules.
